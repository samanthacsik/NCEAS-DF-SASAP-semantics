"doi:10.5063/F1T151XN","This dataset contains annual commercial salmon harvest information from fisheries in Alaska from 1975-2016, provided by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;amp;G).
        Included are the number of fish caught by salmon species, the number of people and permits issued, and the number of fish processors used, and vessels used.
        Three files are included with differing geographic resolutions, which from coarse to fine consist of spatial resolutions: commercial fishing area, commercial fishing district, and commercial fishing subdistrict.
        All files are annual with the exception of one, which organizes harvest data by statistical week. This time scale facilitates aggregated catch comparisons between years. Note that some rows within each file
        are marked as confidential when the number of either permits, people, or processors is under 3. Finer spatial or temporal resolution datasets result in more confidential rows. These data are provided to facilitate
        understanding of commercial harvest of salmon in Alaska, and how this harvest changes both over time and space. Data shown here were modified slightly from what was provided by (ADF&amp;amp;G) by replacing internal species
        and gear codes with more readily understandable species names and gear descriptions.","harvest commercial fishing economic featured sociocultural economic, well being","Commercial salmon harvest data: gross earnings and number of fish, Alaska, 1975-2016","State of Alaska's Salmon and People","YEAR  Year commercial harvest data was collected AREA  Location of commercial harvest data collection District  Management district based on species ADFG_H_GEAR_CODE  ADFG names for the specific apparatus or equipment used to catch fish ADFG_I_SPECIES_CODE  Species of salmon (oncorhynchus sp.) caught Value  The estimated ex-vessel value (gross earnings) of a fish ticket item based on the net pounds multiplied by the price per pound.

"doi:10.5063/F1CJ8BRD","Subsistence fishing is important for the economies and cultures of many families and communities in Alaska. Subsistence uses of wild resources exist alongside other important uses of fish and game in Alaska and are especially important for many rural families who depend on subsistence use for nutrition and traditional cultural practices. Subsistence use is defined as the noncommercial, customary harvest and processing of wild resources for food, raw materials, and other traditional uses. These customs have been a central part of the traditions of many cultural and tribal groups in Alaska for centuries. Today, subsistence and personal use fisheries are open only to Alaska residents that have been living in the state for at least one year. Subsistence and personal use fisheries are managed under different regulations and thus regulations vary by fishery and location across the state. For example, only some fisheries require a permit issued by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and some waters are closed to subsistence fishing, other fisheries have season, gear, and/or bag limit restrictions. Finfish other than salmon, rainbow trout, and steelhead trout may be taken for subsistence purposes at any time in any area of the state by any method unless restricted by the subsistence fishing regulations in the Alaska Administrative Code. Salmon are more strictly regulated and the fisheries require permits, only allow certain gear types, and are restricted to certain waters in the state. The Board of Fisheries (BOF) has the authority to adopt regulations governing the use of fish resources in Alaska. In order to regulate subsistence fisheries and ensure sustainability, the BOF is directed by Alaskan state law to identify fish stocks that are customarily and traditionally used for subsistence in Alaska. After customary and traditional use has been determined for a stock, the amount reasonably necessary for subsistence is set. This is often referred to as the ""ANS."" ANS is typically set for an entire fishery, but occasionally for sub-regions within that fishery. In the Glennallen Subdistrict, there are 3 ANS regions: Lower - confluence of Lower Tonsina and Copper Rivers to the downstream edge of the Chitina-McCarthy bridge; Middle: between the mouth of the Tonsina River and the mouth of the Gakona River; Upper: mouth of the Gakona River to mouth of the Slana river and the Batzulnetas area. ANS values for these regions are as follows: Lower - 25,500-39,000 salmon; Middle - 23,500-31,000 salmon; Upper - 12,000-12,500 salmon. See Fall, J.A., M. Turek, and L. Naves. 2009.

"doi:10.5063/F17S7M2J","The Kuskokwim inseason subsistence catch monitoring project, a partnership between the Orutsararmiut Traditional Native Council (OTNC) and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G), seeks to provide local input from subsistence fisherman on salmon management during the fishing season (Fishery Management Report No. 16-06). Salmon are a highly important resource to residents of the Kuskokwim river drainage, and account for the majority of all wild resources consumed for subsistence in this watershed. The subsistence harvest monitoring program began in 2001, and as of 2004 has specifically centered on the Bethel area subsistence fishery. The OTNC surveys fish camps in the Bethel area every year in June and July for information about fishing activity, whether the camps are reaching their subsistence goals, what kind of fishing gear they are using, and relative run timing and fishing success compared to previous years. Certain data from these forms was redacted to ensure the exact location of the fish camps and families fishing there are kept confidential. Forms were transcribed in to tabular format for each weekly visit to a fish camp. These forms were then reformatted into the summary table, Fish_Camp_Summary_Table.csv. Additional information on project objectives, methods, and results can be found in the archived files ending in ""...InseasonHarvestMonitoring.pdf"". The files ending in ""...infopacket.pdf"" are weekly reports from the OTNC and Kuskokwim River Salmon Management Working Group, which contain data summaries, analyses, and comments from meetings that were held about each of the weekly surveys.

Escapement data are the enumeration of these migrating fish as they pass upstream, and are a widely used index of spawning salmon abundance. These data are important for fisheries management, since most salmon harvest occurs in freshwater rivers during this migration. As a part of management of these salmon stocks, some Alaskan river systems are assigned escapement goals, which generally represent the number of salmon that need to be given the opportunity to spawn to ensure survival of the stock. Generally there are three common types of escapement goals. Biological Escapement Goals (BEGs) are defined in Alaska fishery regulations 5 AAC 39.222(f) as ""the escapement that provides the greatest potential for maximum sustained yield."" Sustainable Escapement Goals (SEGs) are defined in the same section as ""a level of escapement, indicated by an index or an escapement estimate, that is known to provide for sustained yield over a 5 to 10 year period, used in situations where a BEG cannot be estimated or managed for.""

In some cases, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) is granted a waiver by those fishers and processors to published annual data at the commercial fishing area level in annual reports. In an effort to analyze whether trends in confidentiality levels would skew commercial harvest data sourced directly from the CFEC, commercial harvest data were compiled from reports for all regions of Alaska except Prince William Sound, Southeast, and the Arctic. The data was taken from annual salmon fishery management reports, provided by the Alaska Department of Fish & Game, Division of Sport Fish and Commercial Fisheries (http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/sf/publications/). The data from Prince William Sound and Southeast Alaska were not included because the amount of fishers and processors in these regions rarely result in confidential data; the Arctic region was not included due to the lack of commercial fisheries. This dataset includes the original reports as pdf files, the data extracted from the reports, an R markdown file that reformats and compiles the extracted data (CommercialHarvest_Reports.Rmd), and the reformatted data (Commercial_Harvest_Reports.csv).

"doi:10.5063/F1QN652R","Every three years, the Alaska Board of Fish (Board) calls for regional fisheries management proposals, inviting the public to directly participate in fisheries governance. Anyone can submit a proposal and provide written or oral testimony on any of the proposals, which constitute potential regulatory changes and are accessible in an online proposal book. Proposals are logged by Board staff and recorded in the meeting documents, which are stored online and archived at the State, Library, Archives, and Museum (SLAM) in Juneau. Each proposal contains valuable information about stakeholder demographics, affiliations, interests, and positions on allocation disputes. Alaska's inclusion of stakeholders in its decision-making process began in 1959, decades before researchers, managers, and politicians  began advocating for increased stakeholder involvement in fisheries management. Stakeholder participation is now lauded as a key component to successful fisheries management, but little data exists that characterizes and assesses this participation. Using integrated data digitization and coding methods, this database quantifies stakeholder participation in Alaska's fisheries management. This dataset includes a tabular data representation of all Board of Fisheries proposals from 1959-2016 (BOF_Proposals.csv). Proposal materials consisted of scanned pdfs of board generated documents, including proposal books, vote logs, and meeting minutes. The included coding document (BOF_Proposal_Coding.pdf) outlines how to translate the diverse array of information in these documents into a regular tabular structure. Quality control of these data is ongoing, and a number of known issues in the tabular data remain.

Obtaining these data provides decision-makers with the information needed to maintain, protect, and improve recreational fisheries.The survey was first implemented in 1977, capturing harvest only metrics, but was expanded to include harvest plus fish caught and released in 1990. The current version of the survey was last revised in 2011 and is now designed to capture guided and non-guided fishing activity throughout the state of Alaska. The Alaska Sport Fishing Survey database made data from 1996 to 2016 available through a query application. Prior years data have not been included in this dataset, but can be found in historic publications (https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/sf/sportfishingsurvey/index.cfm?ADFG=main.historic). In accordance with guidelines established by Mills and Howe, other than to document that sport fishing occurred, estimates based on fewer than 12 responses should not be used. Estimates based on 12 to 29 responses can be useful in indicating relative orders of magnitude and for assessing long-term trends. Estimates based on 30 or more responses are generally useable. More information about the survey is available at the Alaska Sport Fishing Survey webpage (http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/sf/sportfishingsurvey/).

These data can help researchers estimate population growth rates, age-class distribution and population demographics. Knowing population demographics, growth rates and trends is particularly valuable to fisheries managers who must perform population assessments to inform management decisions. These data are therefore particularly important in valuable fisheries like the salmon fisheries of Alaska. This dataset includes age, sex and length data compiled from annual sampling of commercial and subsistence salmon harvests and research projects in the Coghill and Copper Rivers. It includes data on two salmon species: chinook and sockeye. Age estimates were made by examining scales or bony structures (e.g. otoliths - ear bones). Scales were removed from the side of the fish; usually the left side above the lateral line. Scales or bony structures were then mounted on gummed cards and pressed on acetate to make an impression. The number of freshwater and saltwater annuli (i.e. rings) was counted to estimate age in years. Age is recorded in European Notation, which is a method of recording both fresh and saltwater annuli. For example, for a fish that spent one year in freshwater and 3 years in saltwater, its age is recorded as 1.3. The total fish age is the sum of the first and second numbers, plus one to account for the time between deposition and emergence. Therefore the fish in this example is 5 years old. Fish sex was determined by either examining external morphology (eg. head and belly shape) or internal sex organ. Length was measured in millimeters, generally from mid-eye to the fork of the tail.

Data were collected by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) from the National Water Information Service (NWIS). Information is provided for 80 stations throughout Alaska, all which have associated streamflow discharge data. Information on the station site, data description, and general metadata are included in the metadata attribute set. Each streamflow gauging station is identified by an 8-digit number and each station has a separate data file identified by the site number (site_no). Additional information on gauging stations including site name, lat/long, are included in the site_info.csv file. All streamflow information was collected from USGS streamflow gauging systems. These systems record the elevation of the water in the stream and then convert the water elevation (i.e. stage (ft)) to streamflow (i.e. discharge (ft^3)), using an established curve relationship that relates stage and discharge. The stream river stage is measured to the closest 0.01 inches, by using floats inside a stilling well, by the use of pressure transducers that measure how much pressure is required to a push a gas bubble through a tube (related to the depth of water), or with radar. Most USGS streamgauges record the stage level every 15 minutes, and that data are stored in an electronic data recorder, which is then transfered to USGS. The data was downloaded from USGS via the USGS R package ‘dataRetrieval’. Included in this data package is the R script, ‘USGS_Streamflow_Data_Download.R’, that was used to download this data.

This dataset includes age, sex and length data compiled from annual sampling of commercial and subsistence salmon harvests and research projects in the Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim region of Alaska. It includes data on five salmon species: chinook, chum, coho, pink and sockeye. There is some data on non-salmon species (whitefish, sheefish, longnose sucker, Dolly Varden) in the Yukon dataset. There is an additional data table for more specific information about the locations where samples were collected. Age estimates were made by examining scales or bony structures (e.g. otoliths - ear bones). Scales were removed from the side of the fish; usually the left side above the lateral line. Scales or bony structures were then mounted on gummed cards and pressed on acetate to make an impression. The number of freshwater and saltwater annuli (i.e. rings) was counted to estimate age in years. Fish sex was determined by either examining external morphology (eg. head and belly shape) or internal sex organ. Length was measured in millimeters, generally from mid-eye to the fork of the tail. This data package includes the original data files, reformatting scripts that reformat the original data files into a consistent format, and the reformatted datasets.","age, sex, length","Salmon age, sex, and length data from Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim Region of Alaska, 1960-2017","State of Alaska's Salmon and People","ProjectName  project name sampleDate  date that the sample was collected District  district in which the sample was collected Sub.District  subdistrict in which the sample was collected Location  location where sample was collected ASLProjectType  type of ASL project Gear  type of gear used to collect sample Mesh  mesh size inch Species  species (common name) of sample Run  All salmon species have migration runs that occur during the summer, but some have an additional fall run.

"doi:10.5063/F1VH5M32","The Alaska Department of Public Safety, Division of Alaska Wildlife Troopers is tasked with patrolling a number of domains related to wildlife in Alaska. They provide statewide patrol of commercial big game services, commercial fisheries, sport fish and sport fish guiding, game hunting and trapping, boating safety, and habitat protection including permit compliance. The regulations which are enforced by the Alaska Wildlife Troopers (AWT) are outlined in the Alaska Administrative Code (AAC). As part of the State of Alaska Salmon and People Project, data on violations and enforcement of salmon-related regulations were gathered. These data provide useful insight into the governance and regulation of salmon fisheries in the state, including where violations occur and what the nature of those violations are. Patterns in violation numbers through time and space are not necessarily indicative of changing behavior of fishers through time or in different locations. There are many contributing factors that could lead to a change in the number of violations, the most important of which is the amount of time the AWT is able to patrol. A number of factors influence where and when the AWT conducts enforcement activities, including the number of personnel available, the annual budget, and guidance from other state departments such as the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. For this reason, included in this dataset is not only a list of salmon-related violations, but also contextual information on the staffing of the division. Important to note is although a certain number of positions are authorized each year in the division by the state legislature, for a variety of reasons not all of these positions are filled. When considering temporal trends in the number of violations, this is an important factor to consider, thus the AWT_troopers_positions_filled.csv includes information on the number of filled positions from 2013-2017 in the month of July for each of these years.","governance featured well being","Violations and Enforcement of Salmon Fishing Regulations, Alaska, 2014-2017","State of Alaska's Salmon and People","X  row number number SourceSystem  database source system IncidentNumber  unique identifier of incident ReportedDate  date incident was reported ReportedTime  time incident was reported ClearanceDescription  description of clearance type (closed by arrest, closed by investigation, closed non-criminal, etc) Reportable  whether a violation was reportable or not DispatchTypeDescription  description of dispatch type IncidentType  type of incident IncidentViolationCode  internal code used to identify incident violation ViolationCodeDescription  description of violation code PersonInvolvemntType  classification of person involved in violation (charged, suspect, arrestee) PersonResidenceState  abbreviation of state of residence of person involved in violation CompletionDescription  completion status of the charge (attempted, completed, unfounded) ViolationGroupDescription  AWT groupings of violation descriptions ViolationGroupName  AWT groupings of violations Statute  regulation number in Alaska Statues that was violated Regulation  regulation number in Alaska Administrative Code that was violated OffenseDescription  description of the offense AlcoholUsed  whether alcohol was involved in the offense DrugsUsed  whether drugs were involved in the offense FelonyMisdemeanor  whether the offense was a misdemeanor DomesticViolenceRelated  whether the offense was related to domestic violence GoogleMaps  (latitude, longitude) of location of violation PhysicalAddressLatitude  latitude of violation degree PhysicalAddressLongitude  longitude of violation degree BeatCode  internal identification of patrol area Census_Area  census area of violation Mapped_Beat_Desc  description of beat area IncidentLocation  mapped location of incident UnitID  identifier of AWT unit UnitName  name of AWT unit DetachmentID  identifier of AWT detachment DetachmentName  name of AWT detachment IncidentAgency  name of agency Year  year of incident Sector  sector of offense, as determined by SASAP researchers Category  category of offense, as determined by SASAP researchers SASAP.Region  SASAP region where incident took place Year  year AWT.Troopers  number of commissioned AWT troopers authorized number State.Population  state population of Alaska number CommissionStatus  commission status of position PositionTitle  title of position Year  year of authorization NumPersonnel  number of personnel authorized by the legislature number NumPersonnel  total number of commissioned positions authorized number Status  status indicating whether positions were filled or not Number  total number of positions in each status category number"

We created a closed-loop simulation model to evaluate the Value of Information of various data sources for decision-making regarding in-season harvest management in the Kuskokwim River, Alaska. The information sources we evaluated were (1) improved pre-season forecasts of run size, (2) in-season abundance index data, and (3) in-season harvest estimates.

"doi:10.5063/F1W957GP","Age, sex and length data provide population dynamics information that can indicate how populations trends occur and may be changing. 
These data can help researchers estimate population growth rates, age-class distribution and population demographics. Knowing population demographics, growth rates 
and trends is particularly valuable to fisheries managers who must perform population assessments to inform management decisions. These data are therefore particularly 
important in valuable fisheries like the salmon fisheries of Alaska. This dataset includes age, sex and length data compiled from annual sampling of commercial and 
subsistence salmon harvests and research projects in the Bristol Bay region of Alaska. Age estimates were made by examining scales or bony structures (e.g. otoliths - ear bones). Scales were removed from the side 
of the fish; usually the left side above the lateral line. Scales or bony structures were then mounted on gummed cards and pressed on acetate to make an impression. 
The number of freshwater and saltwater annuli (i.e. rings) was counted to estimate age in years. Fish sex was determined by either examining external morphology 
(eg. head and belly shape) or internal sex organ. Length was measured in millimeters, generally from mid-eye to the fork of the tail. 
This data package includes the original data files and an R script that reformats the original data files into a single dataset, 'bristol_bay_full.csv'.","age, sex, length","Salmon age, sex, and length data from Bristol Bay region of Alaska, 2010-2015","State of Alaska's Salmon and People","sampleDate  date sample was taken District  numeric ID of commercial fishing district where sample was taken dimensionless Sub.District  subdistrict of commercial fishing district dimensionless Location  location where sample was caught Species  species (common name) of fish sampled ASLProjectType  project type Gear  type of gear used to catch fish for sampling cardNo  identifier of card where samples are stored fishNum  number linking to each fish to its sample on a card Sex  biological sex of sampled fish Length  length of fish in millimeters millimeter Weight  weight of fish in kilograms kilogram Age.Error  Age error code.

"doi:10.5063/F1KD1W57","The purpose of this project is to extract historic average Alaskan precipitation across different time intervals for periods of interest (e.g. spawning season, growing season, monthly averages) across different regions of Alaska. Details on the extraction can be found in the file ""PrecipitationHistoric.ipynb"" within this package. In particular, the data files in this package comprise records for regional and temporal subsets of the original dataset, with the regional divisions determined by the SASAP project. These data were derived from the ""Historical Monthly Precipitation - 1 km CRU TS"" dataset, available at http://ckan.snap.uaf.edu/dataset/historical-monthly-precipitation-1-km-cru-ts.

"doi:10.5063/F1222S1G","Age, sex and length data provide population dynamics information that can indicate how populations trends occur and may be changing. These data can help researchers estimate population growth rates, age-class distribution and population demographics. Knowing population demographics, growth rates and trends is particularly valuable to fisheries managers who must perform population assessments to inform management decisions. These data are therefore particularly important in valuable fisheries like the salmon fisheries of Alaska. This dataset includes age, sex and length data compiled from annual sampling of commercial and subsistence salmon harvests and research projects in the Upper Cook Inlet. It includes data on five salmon species: chinook, chum, coho, pink and sockeye. Age estimates were made by examining scales or bony structures (e.g. otoliths - ear bones). Scales were removed from the side of the fish; usually the left side above the lateral line. Scales or bony structures were then mounted on gummed cards and pressed on acetate to make an impression. The number of freshwater and saltwater annuli (i.e. rings) was counted to estimate age in years. Age is recorded in European Notation, which is a method of recording both fresh and saltwater annuli. For example, for a fish that spent one year in freshwater and 3 years in saltwater, its age is recorded as 1.3. The total fish age is the sum of the first and second numbers, plus one to account for the time between deposition and emergence. Therefore the fish in this example is 5 years old. Fish sex was determined by either examining external morphology (eg. head and belly shape) or internal sex organ. Length was measured in millimeters, generally from mid-eye to the fork of the tail.

"doi:10.5063/F1X928KM","The Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) maintains a fish passage inventory database (http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishpassage.database), containing data on stream crossings for fish passage collected as part of the ADFG Fish Passage Assessment Program. This program is charged with assessing the impact of state-owned road crossings of streams on fish passage. Maintaining unobstructed access to stream habitat for fish that migrate up and down these streams (such as salmon) is a critical part of maintaining these fish populations. When designed properly, culverts and bridges at stream crossings do not present a problem to fish passage, however culverts that are too small, too steep, or placed improperly can impede both upstream and downstream movement of fish. The ADFG Fish Passage Assessment Program conducts rapid (Level 1) assessments of culverts to determine their adequacy for fish passage. Streams are classified into three categories: likely to be adequate for fish passage, may be inadequate for fish passage, and likely inadequate for fish passage. The model fish chosen to determine adequacy for passage is a 55mm (juvenile) coho salmon. This fish is chosen because coho salmon are believed to be the weakest swimmers amongst juvenile salmonids, thus any culvert passable by the model fish should be passable for all other fish. For more information on Level 1 assessments, please see Eisenman, M., and G. O’Doherty. 2014. Culvert inventory and assessment manual for fish passage in the State of Alaska: A guide to the procedures and techniques used to inventory and assess stream crossings 2009-2014. Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Special Publication No. 14-08, Anchorage. http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/FedAidPDFs/SP14-08.pdf.  In this dataset, the 2,500 culvert assessments in the original ADFG fish passage inventory database (http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishpassage.database) were classified according to what region the culvert is located in. The total number of culverts by category and region were summarized. The regions used are the regions of the State of Alaska's Salmon and People Project (SASAP), which notably are different than the ADFG management areas. When using this data, sampling effects must be taken into effect. The fish passage inventory database does not include all culverts in the state, just those where surveys have been completed.  Additionally, this may not be an entirely accurate picture of fish passage given the fact that many areas need re-survey to update culverts that have been replaced since the initial survey. Thus some of the culvert assessment data may be out of date, as culverts are continually being replaced and improved. Finally, the model fish must be taken into account when interpreting these data. The majority of the ""inadequate for fish passage"" culverts are not total barriers to fish passage, however they are barriers to the model fish, which is the 55mm coho salmon.","governance featured","Regional fish passage assessment, Alaska, 2000-2017","State of Alaska's Salmon and People",NA

"doi:10.5063/F12Z13SN","Fishery disaster determinations are made by the Secretary of Commerce through National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries. A fishery disaster refers to a commercial fishery failure, a catastrophic regional fishery disaster, significant harm incurred, or a serious disruption affecting future production due to a fishery resource disaster arising from natural, undetermined, or in certain circumstances man-made causes. The general process for these determinations is that an eligible entity (such as a state Governor) requests a fishery disaster determination from the Secretary of Commerce. NOAA fisheries then conducts an evaluation of the information provided, which is used by the Secretary to make a determination to approve or deny the request for disaster declaration. Then, if a disaster is determined, Congress may appropriate funds for relief. If funds are appropriated, NOAA Fisheries works with the affected entities to distribute the funds. This dataset contains fishery disaster determinations for Alaska salmon fisheries from 1997-2018. The file ""fishery_disaster_request_details.csv"" contains details on the disaster including a short description, the amount of funding appropriated (if the disaster was declared), what area is affected, the dates(s) of request, and the requestor. This file was derived from information obtained from the NOAA website.

"doi:10.5063/F1891459","Brood tables, also called run reconstructions, utilize annual estimates of the total run (commercial catch plus escapement), and samples of ages, to estimate the number of recruits per age class. These data are useful for salmon biologists to understand salmon productivity and salmon life histories. These data can come in a number of different formats, but generally follow the pattern of: rows for each brood year, and columns for the estimated number of fish in each age class. This dataset consists of reformated and merged brood tables from Alaska, British Columbia, and Washington. These datasets were gathered as part of the State of Alaskan Salmon and People project (https://alaskasalmonandpeople.org/). Source information for the datasets can be found in the SourceInfo.csv file. A description of the merging and quality assurance process can be found in the broodTableProcessing.html file. Productivity (R/S) should not be directly compared among the stocks because some escapement counts are indices. Age classes are given in European Notation, where the first number is the number of winters spent in freshwater before going to sea (1 winter in freshwater = age-1.X), and the second number is the number of winters spent at se (3 winters at sea = age-X.3).","brood table featured ocean climate","Sockeye salmon brood tables, northeastern Pacific, 1922-2016","State of Alaska's Salmon and People","Stock.ID  Unique stock identifier Species  species of stock Stock  Stock name, generally river where stock is found Ocean.Region  Ocean region Region  Region of stock Sub.Region  Sub.Region of stock Jurisdiction  Management jurisdiction Lat  Latitude degree Lon  Longitude degree UseFlag  Indicates if data should be used in analysis BroodYear  Brood Year TotalEscapement  Total escapement value number R0.1  number of recruits in 0.1 age class number R0.2  number of recruits in 0.2 age class number R0.3  number of recruits in 0.3 age class number R0.4  number of recruits in 0.4 age class number R0.5  number of recruits in 0.5 age class number R1.1  number of recruits in 1.1 age class number R1.2  number of recruits in 1.2 age class number R1.3  number of recruits in 1.3 age class number R1.4  number of recruits in 1.4 age class number R1.5  number of recruits in 1.5 age class number R2.1  number of recruits in 2.1 age class number R2.2  number of recruits in 2.2 age class number R2.3  number of recruits in 2.3 age class number R2.4  number of recruits in 2.4 age class number R3.1  number of recruits in 3.1 age class number R3.2  number of recruits in 3.2 age class number R3.3  number of recruits in 3.3 age class number R3.4  number of recruits in 3.4 age class number R4.1  number of recruits in 4.1 age class number R4.2  number of recruits in 4.2 age class number R4.3  number of recruits in 4.3 age class number TotalRecruits  number of total recruits number Date.data.obtained  Date data was obtained; if original data did not specify the day, the day is recorded as 01 Date.data.incorporated  Date data was incorporated into database; if original data did not specify the day, the day is recorded as 01 Source.ID  Source.ID, matches source.ID in source info file Comment..we.will.update.this.later.  stock comments Source.ID  Source.ID as seen in stock info table Source  Source description"
"doi:10.5063/F1736P5F","This dataset contains a list of all the Fish Habitat Permits and permit amendments issued under The Anadromous Fish Act (AS 16.05.871- .901) for authority for work in anadromous streams from July 1, 2008 through Jun 30, 2018. The Anadromous Fish Act (AS 16.05.871- .901) requires that an individual or government agency provide notification and obtain permitted approval from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) before conducting activities that may alter or affect “the natural flow or bed” of an anadromous water body. The location of specified anadromous waterbodies is contained in the “Catalog of Waters Important for the Spawning Rearing or Migration of Anadromous Fishes,” also called the Anadromous Waters Catalog (AWC) is updated annually, and is the legal record of known anadromous fish streams in the state. All activities within or across a specified anadromous waterbody require permitted approval from the ADFG Habitat Division. These activities may include construction; road crossings; gravel removal; mining; water withdrawals; the use of vehicles or equipment in the waterway; stream realignment or diversion; bank stabilization; blasting; the placement, excavation, deposition, or removal of any material. This dataset includes information on the water body of proposed activity, the location name of the activity, the name of the applicant, the date the permit was approved, and the activity type. This dataset deliberately excludes small scale/recreational mining permits over-the-counter permits (similar to a general permit). These small scale permits are numerous (around 6000 over the total time period), but are similar to a general permit and are issued to individuals over-the-counter. A region for the State of Alaska's Salmon and People Project (SASAP) is assigned to each permit based on a combination of the waterbody code, and in the event of an ambiguous or unknown code, the location description. The original dataset activity types were also consolidated, grouping together related types into the same name (eg oil and gas; oil and gas exploration). Data were reformatted from the original file into the cleaned up habitat_permits.csv using the RMarkdown document habitat_permits.Rmd. The original dataset includes some permits without a permit number - these represent permit reviews that resulted in a 'no permit required' determination or where an applicant withdrew their application. The original dataset also contains duplicate permit numbers, representing permits with multiple locations in the same general area (such as multiple crossings of the same stream) or permits with amendments. Both the duplicate permits and permits with no permit number were removed in the reformatted version of this dataset to reflect accurately the number of permitted activities, as opposed to the number of locations in which these activities occurred.","governance featured","Fish habitat permits for work in anadromous streams in Alaska, 2008-2018","State of Alaska's Salmon and People","project_number  Internal identifier of permit used by ADFG water_body_number  Anadromous Waters Catalog (AWC) number of waterbody affected by permitted activity location  name of the waterbody or general area where permitted activity will take place applicant  name of applicant for permit final_action_date  date of final approval of permit by ADFG Habitat Division SASAP.Region  name of SASAP region where activity location takes place year  year of final action date type  type of activity to be conducted under the permit terms"
"doi:10.5063/F1ZW1J77","This dataset contains digitized scale measurement data from sockeye salmon scales taken in Alaska. The locations where scales were sampled are the Copper River, Coghill River, Egegik River, and Hugh Smith Lake. Salmon scales are aged by examining growth annuli on the scale. Sockeye salmon typically spend one to two winters in fresh water, and one to three winters in the ocean prior to returning to freshwater to spawn. Growth during summer months is rapid, and increases the size of the scale by widely spaced circular rings (circuli). Slow growth during winter months leads to more narrowly spaced circuli. In this dataset, measurements are presented as the length (in millimeters) between each circuli. Accompanying these individual measurements is the established age of the fish (in European notation, where a 13 would be 1 year in fresh water and 3 in the ocean), the sex of the fish, and the length of the fish.  Included in this dataset are the original excel files for each aged stock, an Rmarkdown document which reformats and merges these files, and a csv file of all of the data contained within the excel files. The included PDF document details the methods for measuring annuli more clearly.","ocean climate age, sex, length","Sockeye salmon age measurements from scale data, Alaska, 2011-2017","State of Alaska's Salmon and People","location  location where sample was taken image_name  name of scale image sample_date  date sample was taken year  year sample was taken age  age in european notation sex  sex of fish sampled length  length of fish sampled millimeter zone  annual growth zone abbreviation zone_name  name of annual growth zone user_id  user entering data project  project identifier by  brood year of fish yr_sea  year fish went to sea comment  sample comments circuli_count  number of circuli in zone millimeter c1  distance between the focus and first circuli (c1) millimeter c2  distance between circuli 1 and circuli 2 millimeter c3  distance between circuli 2 and circuli 3 millimeter c4  distance between circuli 3 and circuli 4 millimeter c5  distance between circuli 4 and circuli 5 millimeter c6  distance between circuli 5 and circuli 6 millimeter c7  distance between circuli 6 and circuli 7 millimeter c8  distance between circuli 7 and circuli 8 millimeter c9  distance between circuli 8 and circuli 9 millimeter c10  distance between circuli 9 and circuli 10 millimeter c11  distance between circuli 10 and circuli 11 millimeter c12  distance between circuli 11 and circuli 12 millimeter c13  distance between circuli 12 and circuli 13 millimeter c14  distance between circuli 13 and circuli 14 millimeter c15  distance between circuli 14 and circuli 15 millimeter c16  distance between circuli 15 and circuli 16 millimeter c17  distance between circuli 16 and circuli 17 millimeter c18  distance between circuli 17 and circuli 18 millimeter c19  distance between circuli 18 and circuli 19 millimeter c20  distance between circuli 19 and circuli 20 millimeter c21  distance between circuli 20 and circuli 21 millimeter c22  distance between circuli 21 and circuli 22 millimeter c23  distance between circuli 22 and circuli 23 millimeter c24  distance between circuli 23 and circuli 24 millimeter c25  distance between circuli 24 and circuli 25 millimeter c26  distance between circuli 25 and circuli 26 millimeter c27  distance between circuli 26 and circuli 27 millimeter c28  distance between circuli 27 and circuli 28 millimeter c29  distance between circuli 28 and circuli 29 millimeter c30  distance between circuli 29 and circuli 30 millimeter c31  distance between circuli 30 and circuli 31 millimeter c32  distance between circuli 31 and circuli 32 millimeter c33  distance between circuli 32 and circuli 33 millimeter c34  distance between circuli 33 and circuli 34 millimeter c35  distance between circuli 34 and circuli 35 millimeter c36  distance between circuli 35 and circuli 36 millimeter c37  distance between circuli 36 and circuli 37 millimeter c38  distance between circuli 37 and circuli 38 millimeter c39  distance between circuli 38 and circuli 39 millimeter c40  distance between circuli 39 and circuli 40 millimeter c41  distance between circuli 40 and circuli 41 millimeter c42  distance between circuli 41 and circuli 42 millimeter c43  distance between circuli 42 and circuli 43 millimeter"

"doi:10.5063/F14B2ZMJ","This database contains salmon escapement data collected primarily by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Division of Commercial Fisheries (ADF&amp;amp;amp;amp;G-CF), in the Lower Cook Inlet (LCI) management area in southcentral Alaska.  To facilitate informed inseason management of commercial fisheries targeting Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp., ADF&amp;amp;amp;amp;G-CF uses a variety of methods to monitor escapement on select index streams in LCI (e.g., aerial/ground survey, weir, remote video).  Aerial and ground surveyors make periodic counts of sockeye O. nerka, chum O. keta, and pink O. gorbuscha salmon throughout the duration of their respective runs, whereas weir and remote video projects document daily fish passage.  Fishery managers use these data daily to manipulate time and area fishery openings/closures to assure that the final escapement level for monitored stocks falls within their individual escapement goal ranges. At the end of the season, periodic aerial and ground survey counts are used to calculate a final escapement index for each stream based on the area-under-the-curve method (AUC; pink and chum salmon) or the peak survey count (sockeye salmon).  This LCI salmon escapement database spans the period 1927–2018, which includes data collected by federal fisheries personnel prior to Alaska statehood (1959).  The database is comprised of 6 related tables and 1 stand-alone table.  Four of the related tables are lookup tables defining primary key fields that are linked to the main data tables. The 2 linked main data tables (1_Escapement Header and 2_Escapement Data) respectively contain relevant details for each survey/escapement monitoring project conducted (e.g., survey ID, date, survey type, survey conditions, etc.) and the fine scale results for each survey ID (e.g., live/dead count by species, stream, stream section, etc.).  The escapement data table includes XY coordinates for counts (typically stratified by stream section) so the data can be viewed/analyzed spatially.  Finally, because it may be difficult for users of this database to convert individual survey counts into final escapement indices, this database also includes a stand-alone table (3_Reported Escapement) that provides final escapements by stock, species, and year, as well as associated information such as the method used to derive the escapement.

Format is ""YYYY_XXXX_S#"" where Y is the year, X is the abbreviated Stock name, S is the first letter of the survey type, # is the survey number SURVEY_NUMBER  Begins each year at 1, and increments by 1 each time a survey occurs that year.  Survey number is stratified by stock and survey type.  If multiple survey types are applied to the same Stock each method will increment from 1. number YEAR  Year in which the survey/escapement project was DATE  Date the survey/escapement project was conducted. TIME  The time the survey was conducted, if available. SURVEY_TYPE  Method used to collect the escapement data (e.g., foot survey, aerial survey, weir, video) OBSERVER  Name of the primary surveyor (aerial), or surveyors PILOT  Name of the survey pilot. SURVEY_RATING  A numerical rating of the survey conditions, from 1-5, where 1 = excellent and 5 = unsatisfactory SURVEY_CONDITIONS  Surveyors comments on the conditions experienced at the time of the survey. COUNTABLE_VIDEO  Applies to remote video projects; documents the accumulative hours:minutes:seconds of video that were of sufficient quality to facilitate counting individual fish. REMARKS  Comments made by the surveyor. ID  Auto number record ID STREAM_SECTION  Specific identifier of where in the stream the fish counts were made (e.g., bay, lagoon, intertidal, stream, lake). SPECIES  Common name of fish counted. COUNT  Number of fish counted. number CONDITION  Live or dead when counted. LATITUDE  Decimal degree latitude of the observation. degree LONGITUDE  Decimal degree longitude of the observation. degree POSITION  Identifies spatial accuracy of latitude and longitude data. General = Exact location not know; coordinates represent midpoint of stream section fish were observed. GPS = This count was entered into a GPS enabled recorder at this specific location DATA_EDIT_COMMENT  A comment entered about the data after the survey to capture changes made or unique information that may be useful YEAR  The year in which the escapement occurred. STOCK  General identifier of which major stream, or group of nearby streams, the fish are associated with; escapement is calculated by stock rather than individual streams/tributaries comprising the stock complex. REPORTED_ESCAPEMENT  Escapement value published in the Annual Management Report (AMR) for the year the surveys occurred. Synonymous with Official Escapement unless a correction was made retrospectively. number OFFICIAL_ESCAPEMENT  By Stock, the current best estimate of the number of fish to have escaped. If different from ""Reported Escapement"" a correction was made either to an error, or a retrospective analysis based on new information produced revised escapement values. number SURVEY_TYPE  Method used to make observations, e.g., foot survey, aerial survey, weir, video, ... METHOD  The method used to calculate the official escapement value from the available escapement data collected that year (e.g., area under the curve [AUC], peak count, accumulative count, AUC+BCLS [Bay count last survey]). STREAM_LIFE  Represents the average number of days a salmon is alive in fresh water once it returns to spawn as an adult.  This is a key parameter used in an Area Under The Curve (AUC) calculation to estimate final escapement from periodic survey counts. nominalDay START_DATE  The date representing the beginning of the run for a given stock and year.  Key parameter used in pre-2000 Area Under The Curve (AUC) calculations where the user had to define the start/end dates of the run for the AUC model. END_DATE  The date representing the end of the run for a given stock and year.  Key parameter used in pre-2000 Area Under The Curve (AUC) calculations where the user had to define the start/end dates of the run for the AUC model.

The value represents the % of the run in the river on date of last survey, according to a run-timing curve. dimensionless NOTES  Comments regarding the official escapement value and how it was derived. STREAM_SECTION  A field that combines the stream name and the section of that stream within which escapement counts were stratified. DISTRICT  One of the four districts in the Lower Cook Inlet Management Area (LCIMA) that contain salmon stocks and commercial salmon fisheries (salmon do not occur in the Barren Islands District). INDEX_AREA  A geographical area (finer scale than District) that contains one or more LCIMA index streams.  This field was primarily used when hard copy survey maps were used to record counts during surveys. SECTION  Standardized general location within the stream where the fish were counted (e.g., Bay, Lagoon, Intertidal, Stream, Lake) STREAM  Mid level identifier of where fish counts were made. In a simple system stream is the same as stock, but sometimes more than one individual stream or tributary makes up a stock group. ABBREVIATED_NAME  A four character code that approximates a Stock's abbreviated name. Used primarily in file naming. CURRENT_2018_DIST_SUBD  The 2018 LCIMA District-Subdistrict where the stream occurs.  Subdistrict boundaries and names/codes can change over time.  The value listed here was the name/code current in 2018. CF_S_CODE  Commercial Fisheries Stream Code. A four digit numeric code used historically to identify individual streams in Lower Cook Inlet.  Not used any longer, but retained for cross referencing to current stream names.

"doi:10.5063/F1542KVC","This data set contains information on the high-seas tag recovery program for salmon and steelhead from the 1950s to 2013 in the North Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Alaska, and Bering Sea, from the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission. The database was last updated in April of 2016, and this version was provided in November of 2016. Data are provided on the location, species, age, sex, and initial tag location. Annual high seas salmon recovery information have been reported annually to the International North Pacific Fisheries Commission (1981–1992) and to the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (1993–present). The tag recovery program enables the investigation of ocean distribution, migration, and growth of salmon at sea. Here, only information from non-electronic tags are reported. Information are available for salmon species: chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), chum (Oncorhynchus keta), coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch), pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka), and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Researchers using these data are cautioned to possible biases in the data caused from non-random area of tag release and from recovery of tagged fish in coastal areas that may not reflect the basin or area of origin. A discussion of these issues is provided in Myers et al. (1996).  Included maps are generated from the dataset and show the release month by species, and the recovery region at release point. These maps were created by researchers at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis.","ocean distribution featured biophysical","INPFC/NPAFC High-seas salmonid tag-recovery database, 1956 - 2013","State of Alaska's Salmon and People","RecordNo  Record number TagType1  Tag type and color of primary tag TagNo1  First tag number TagType2  Tag type and color of secondary tag (if used) TagNo2  Second tag number TagType3  Tag type and color of tertiary tag (if used) TagNo3  Third tag number DSTNo  Data storage tag number (if used) DSTTask  Onboard sensors measuring environmental conditions on the data storage tag (DST) RelAgency  Agency that released tagged fish SpeciesNo  Species code of the tagged fish Species  Species of the tagged fish RelMonth  Month of release RelDay  Day of release (date applying to east of dateline) RelYear  Year of release (date applying to east of dateline) Rel2x5Area  INPFC 2 degree by 5 degree statistical area RelLongDeg  Longitude degrees at release degree RelLongMin  Longitude minutes at release degree RelHem  Release Hemisphere RelLatDeg  Latitude degrees at release degree RelLatMin  Latitude minutes at release degree RelLongDec  Release longitude degree RelLongDecDir  Release longitude and direction; degrees progressing westward from 0 degree longitude (in the W hemisphere) are negative; degrees progressing eastward from 0 degree longitude (in the E hemisphere) are positive degree RelLongDec360  360 degree release longitude degree RelLongDec360Neg  360 degree release negative longitude degree RelLatDec  Release latitude degree RelSetNo  Release vessel or operation code and set number combined RelGear  Code for gear used to catch fish for tagging RelFishDir  Direction of movement of fish; only FRI data, blank in CDFO, FAJ, and ADFG data RelBisect  Release 2 degree by 5 degree statistical areas that are bisected by Aleutian or Kurile Islands; for tagging on Pacific side RelADFG  ADFG offshore index station number RelLength  Length at release, in millimeters millimeter RelCondition  Condition at release RelScaleNo  Code for scale sample collected at release.

"doi:10.5063/F18P5XTN","Subsistence fishing is important for the economies and cultures of many families and communities in Alaska. Subsistence uses of wild resources exist alongside other important uses of fish and game in Alaska and are especially important for many rural families who depend on subsistence use for nutrition and traditional cultural practices. Subsistence use is defined as the noncommercial, customary harvest and processing of wild resources for food, raw materials, and other traditional uses. These customs have been a central part of the traditions of many cultural and tribal groups in Alaska for centuries. Today, subsistence and personal use fisheries are open only to Alaska residents that have been living in the state for at least one year. The Board of Fisheries (BOF) has the authority to adopt regulations governing the use of fish resources in Alaska. In order to regulate subsistence fisheries and ensure sustainability, the BOF is directed by Alaskan state law to identify fish stocks that are customarily and traditionally used for subsistence in Alaska. After customary and traditional use has been determined for a stock, the amount reasonably necessary for subsistence is set. Subsistence and personal use fisheries are managed under different regulations and thus regulations vary by fishery and location across the state. For example, only some fisheries require a permit issued by ADFG and some waters are closed to subsistence fishing, other fisheries have season, gear, and/or bag limit restrictions. Finfish other than salmon, rainbow trout, and steelhead trout may be taken for subsistence purposes at any time in any area of the state by any method unless restricted by the subsistence fishing regulations in the Alaska Admin Code. Salmon are more strictly regulated and the fisheries require permits, only allow certain gear types, and are restricted to certain waters in the state.  This dataset includes information on subsistence salmon harvest from 1960-2012 across the 
entire state of Alaska. The csv file ""ASFDB_FullPermit.csv"" has been reformatted from the original excel file (""ASFDB_Full_PermitTypeDetail.xlsx""). 
This processing was done using the R Markdown file, ""subsistence_harvest_processing.Rmd"". Each entry is a report from a specific fishery and community 
in Alaska including permit type, resource type, year, and harvest (both reported and estimated). For each species, harvest data include both the number 
of fish and the edible weight in lbs (dressed, head off). See methods for additional data considerations. Also included in this dataset are 48 figures generated by

"doi:10.5063/F1S75DNC","Subsistence uses of wild resources are defined as 'noncommercial, customary and traditional uses' for a variety of purposes. 
These include: direct personal or family consumption as food, shelter, fuel, clothing, tools, or transportation, for the making and selling of handicraft
articles out of nonedible by-products of fish and wildlife resources taken for personal or family consumption, and for the customary trade, barter, or 
sharing for personal or family consumption. Under subsistence statute in Alaska, the Alaska Board of Fisheries must identify fish stocks that support
subsistence fisheries and, if there is a harvestable surplus of these stocks, adopt regulations that provide reasonable opportunities for these subsistence 
uses to take place. Whenever it is necessary to restrict harvests, subsistence fisheries have a preference over other uses of the stock. Subsistence fishing 
and subsistence hunting are important for the economies and cultures of many families and communities in Alaska. Subsistence uses of wild resources exist
alongside other important uses of fish and game in Alaska and are especially important for most rural families, who depend on subsistence hunting and fishing
as sources of nutrition and cultural practices. An estimated 36.9 million pounds of wild foods are harvested annually by rural subsistence users. Residents 
of more populated urban areas harvest about 13.4 million pounds of wild food under subsistence, personal use, and sport regulations. Harvest and community 
information is given here. Harvest information includes participation in subsistence activities as well as estimates of community, household, and per capita

"doi:10.5063/F11R6NSS","Age, sex and length data provide population dynamics information that can indicate how populations trends occur and may be changing. These data can help researchers estimate population growth rates, age-class distribution and population demographics. Knowing population demographics, growth rates and trends is particularly valuable to fisheries managers who must perform population assessments to inform management decisions. These data are therefore particularly important in valuable fisheries like the salmon fisheries of Alaska. This dataset includes age, sex and length data compiled from annual sampling of commercial and subsistence salmon harvests and research projects in the Upper Cook Inlet. It includes data on five salmon species: chinook, chum, coho, pink and sockeye. Age estimates were made by examining scales or bony structures (e.g. otoliths - ear bones). Scales were removed from the side of the fish; usually the left side above the lateral line. Scales or bony structures were then mounted on gummed cards and pressed on acetate to make an impression. The number of freshwater and saltwater annuli (i.e. rings) was counted to estimate age in years. Age is recorded in European Notation, which is a method of recording both fresh and saltwater annuli. For example, for a fish that spent one year in freshwater and 3 years in saltwater, its age is recorded as 1.3. The total fish age is the sum of the first and second numbers, plus one to account for the time between deposition and emergence. Therefore the fish in this example is 5 years old. Fish sex was determined by either examining external morphology (eg. head and belly shape) or internal sex organ. Length was measured in millimeters, generally from mid-eye to the fork of the tail. This dataset includes samples of Chinook salmon from 4 major rivers in Southeast Alaska: the Chilkat River, Stikine River, Taku River, and Unuk River.

directly participate in fisheries governance. Anyone can submit a proposal and provide written or oral testimony on any of the proposals, which constitute
potential regulatory changes and are accessible in an online proposal book. Proposals are logged by Board staff and recorded in the meeting documents, which
are stored online and archived at the State, Library, Archives, and Museum (SLAM) in Juneau. Each proposal contains valuable information about stakeholder 
demographics, affiliations, interests, and positions on allocation disputes. This dataset contains proposals related to salmon fisheries over the entire state

This dataset includes all permits, limited entry and interim, for Alaska residents. Non-residents that renewed their permit with an out-of-state address are not included.
The source of this permit information is various forms collected by CFEC including permit application, transfer requests, and address change forms. This dataset also includes
a set of maps showing the percent change in permits from the number of initial issues. These maps were created using the included R markdown document in conjunction with code from Jeanette Clark, Rachel Carlson, and Jared Kibele.

"doi:10.5063/F1SF2TG1","Brood tables, also called run reconstructions, utilize annual estimates of the total run (commercial catch plus escapement), and samples of ages, to estimate the number of recruits per age class. These data are useful for salmon biologists to understand salmon productivity and salmon life histories. These data can come in a number of different formats, but generally follow the pattern of: rows for each brood year, and columns for the estimated number of fish in each age class. This dataset consists of reformatted coho salmon brood tables that have been compiled together. These datasets were gathered as part of the State of Alaska Salmon and People project (https://alaskasalmonandpeople.org/). The file ""CohoBroodTables_FW_SW_Age.csv"" includes stocks where age classes are in freshwater/saltwater notation (number of winters in freshwater, followed by number of winters in saltwater). The file ""CohoBroodTables_TotalAge.csv"" includes stocks where age classes are presented as total age (number of winters in freshwater + number of winters at sea + 1). Stocks that have data in freshwater/saltwater age had their total age calculated and were then added to the total age table. The file cohoBroodTableProcessing.Rmd details the data reformatting steps in R Markdown, and cohoBroodTableProcessing.html is the html output of the Rmd file.

"doi:10.5063/F18G8J0D","As salmon migrate from the marine environment to freshwater streams to spawn, a certain number are allowed to pass through, or '/escape/' the salmon fishery (frequently located near the mouth of the freshwater stream) as a management strategy to preserve the species. Escapement data are the enumeration of these migrating fish as they pass upstream, and represent an index of the total abundance of spawning salmon in that particular stream. These data are important for fisheries management, since most salmon harvest occurs in freshwater rivers during this migration. Escapement data are collected in a variety of ways. Stationary projects utilize observers stationed along freshwater corridors who count salmon as they pass upriver through weirs or past elevated towers. Sonar equipment placed in the river can also give a stationary escapement count. These counts usually represent a sample, and are expanded to represent a 24h period. Escapement data can also be collected using aerial surveys, where observers in an aircraft provide an index to estimate escapement. In general, escapement counts do not represent total abundance, but instead an index of abundance. Surveys are usually timed to coincide with peak spawning activity, generally in the summer, but in the case of Coho salmon in the fall as well. Some data about non-salmon species are also included. This dataset contains compiled annual data from multiple sources.

Escapement data are the enumeration of these migrating fish as they pass upstream, and are a widely used index of spawning salmon abundance. These data are important for fisheries management, since most salmon harvest occurs in freshwater rivers during this migration.

IPUMS National Historical Geographic Information System: Version 12.0 [Database]. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota. 2017. http://doi.org/10.18128/D050.V12.0).  A number of relevant tables of basic demographics on age and race, household income and poverty levels,

various dimensions of well-being in Alaskan communities. The file ""censusdata_master.csv"" is a consolidation of all 21 other data files in the package. 
For detailed information on how the datasets vary over different years, view the file ""readme.docx"" available in this data package. The included .Rmd file 
is a script which combines the 21 files by year into a single file (censusdata_master.csv). It also cleans up place names (including typographical errors) 
and uses the USGS place names dataset and the SASAP regions dataset to assign latitude and longitude values and region values to each place in the dataset. 
Note that some places were not assigned a region or location because they do not fit well into the regional framework. Considerable heterogeneity exists between
census surveys each year. While we have attempted to combine these datasets in a way that makes sense, there may be some discrepancies or unexpected values.

"doi:10.5063/F1MK6B60","The purpose of this project is to extract historic average Alaskan air temperatures across different time intervals for periods of interest (e.g. spawning season, growing season, monthly averages) across different regions of Alaska. Details on the extraction can be found in the file ""AirTempHistoric.ipynb"" within this package.
    In particular, the data files in this package comprise records for regional and temporal subsets of the original dataset, with the regional divisions determined by the SASAP (State of Alaska's Salmon and People) project. These data were derived from the ""Historical Monthly Temperature - 1 km CRU TS"" dataset, available at http://ckan.snap.uaf.edu/dataset/historical-monthly-temperature-1-km-cru-ts. The Historical Monthly Temperature - 1 km CRU TS dataset was created by Matthew Leonawicz, Michael Lindgren, Tom Kurkowski (takurkowski@alaska.edu), Scott Rupp, and John Walsh, funded by the Arctic

A growing body of literature identifies well-being as an important dimension of environmental sustainability and central to effective management of fisheries and marine ecosystems. This project builds on these efforts and provides a path forward in defining and incorporating well-being measures into salmon governance and decision-making arenas that continue to struggle with data availability and broad assumptions about important components of quality of life and well-being. We provide insights and clearly defined measures that are needed to create a baseline and monitor diverse components of well-being. Building on earlier efforts, our diverse team developed a collective definition of well-being as “a way of being with others that arises when people and ecosystems are healthy, and when individuals, families, and communities equitably practice their chosen ways of life and enjoy a self-defined quality of life now and for future generations.” In this dataset, we present a set of dimensions of well-being important to Alaska, and classify them into domains.

"doi:10.5063/F1BR8QG4","This dataset compiles salmon escapement data from Alaska Department of Fish and Game reports and salmon harvest data from commercial, personal use, sport fish, and subsistence sectors to generate an estimate of total salmon abundance in each of the regions defined by the State of Alaska's Salmon and People Project (SASAP). This dataset was assembled to enable a broad view of the salmon resource, whether biological (escapement) or economic/cultural (harvest), across regions. With that intent in mind, a fish is counted within a region if it escaped a fishery and was counted in a river that is contained within that region, or if it was caught in a fishery that is within the region. For commercial fisheries, each commercial fishing district was assigned to a region based on the location of the commercial fishing district relative to the bounding watersheds of the region. No effort was made to determine the region of origin for any commercially caught fish - thus for some regions, fish caught in one region may have been headed to spawn in another. This is especially true of Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Islands commercial fishing areas, which are well known for having large amounts of Bristol Bay bound fish. Note that some regions have missing escapement data during some years.  This dataset includes an R Markdown file which processes the original data and creates figures, the rendered html file generated from running the R Markdown file which includes many figures and data explanation, and several standalone versions of those figures.

"doi:10.5063/F1XK8CVG","International organizations, nations, and specific regions and communities increasingly recognize well-being as an integral goal of sustainable development. Scientists identify well-being as central to effective management of fisheries and marine ecosystems. This project builds on these efforts and provides a path forward in defining and incorporating well-being measures into salmon governance and decision-making arenas. We developed objective, subjective, and relational indicators to better identify what promotes and what threatens well-being in Alaska’s diverse salmon systems. We especially considered well-being concepts inclusive of Indigenous people’s priorities and perspectives. Our team identified and evaluated over 250 indicators. We found that even among our highest-ranked indicators, few indicators were universally applicable across Alaska. Additionally, our working group members also had varied opinions about what domains and indicators should be prioritized for study and assessment. We, therefore, identified suitable sample indicators that communities can refine to be more locally relevant. We also identified super indicators that measure multiple domains, like “change in median age of fishermen.” For more information on indicator domains and attributes, see: Rachel Donkersloot, Courtney Carothers, Jessica Black, and Danielle Ringer. Well-Being Domains and Attributes, 2018. Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity. doi:10.5063/F1R20ZN2. Indicators present a potential solution but it is easy to tell the wrong story when relying on simple measures without appropriate context or cultural grounding. An understanding of how people define their own well-being should be the first step in attempts to develop and apply indicators, with communities engaged from the onset in processes of indicator development and selection. We present our work here with a note of caution where direct community involvement and evaluation is most effective and appropriate for assessing the well-being of people and communities.  This dataset contains numeric representations of some of the 250 indicators identified and evaluated as part of the working group process. From a data perspective, they can be grouped roughly into 4 domains: demographic, commercial fishing, sport fishing, and subsistence/personal use fishing.

"doi:10.5063/F1HM56Q3","This data represents harvest of salmon in Alaska across the commercial, subsistence, personal use, and sport fish sectors. Each of these harvest sectors has a distinct permitting system governed by different departments within the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG). Commercial harvest is regulated under the Commercial Entry Fishery Commission (CFEC), and refers to the harvest of fish for the purposes of selling them to another party. Subsistence harvest is regulated under the ADFG Subsistence Division, and refers to the harvest of fish for customary and traditional use. Whether use of a stock of fish is considered a ""customary and traditional"" use is determined by several factors, including length and consistency of use, seasonality, methods and means of harvest, geographic areas, means of handling, preparing, preserving, and storing, intergenerational transmission of knowledge and skills, distribution and exchange, and diversity of resources in an area. Personal use harvest is also governed by the ADFG Subsistence Division. The personal use fishery was created in response to the enactment of the state's subsistence priority law, which precluded some individuals from participating in customary and traditional subsistence fisheries because the stocks they fish are not classified as customary and traditional use stocks. Because the gear associated with the personal use fishery is distinct from the gear typically associated with the sport fishery, the personal use fishery was kept distinct from the sport fishery to prevent confusion amongst the public. More information on the personal use fishery can be found in the Alaska state regulations, Chapter 77 ""Personal Use Fishery, Article 1” (5 AAC 77.001). Sport fish harvest is regulated under the ADFG Division of Sport Fish, and refers to the taking of or attempting to take for personal consumption, and not for sale or barter, a fish by hook and line either held in the hand or closely attended.

"doi:10.5063/F1CV4G17","The Commercial Fisheries Entry Commision (CFEC) is an independent, autonomous 
agency of the State of Alaska which regulates entry into Alaska's commercial fisheries. The CFEC is committed
to promoting conservation and sustained-yield management of Alaska's unique fishery resources and boosting economic 
stability among fishermen and their dependents. To ensure effective management of commercial fisheries, all vessels 
used for commercial fishing or related activities must be licensed by the CFEC. This includes fishing vessels, tenders,
packers, processors, transporter vessels, and seine skiffs. The CFEC is responsible for leasing all commercial fishing
permits including permits for limited-entry fisheries. Limited-entry fisheries include all state salmon fisheries, most
herring fisheries, and various other fisheries. This dataset includes permit information of all state commercial fisheries
between 1975 and 2016. Permit information includes fishery, permit type, permit holder name and address, dates of permit,
vessel identification, and information on transferable nature of individual permits. The source of this permit information
is various forms collected by CFEC including permit application, transfer requests, and address change forms. This dataset includes the public
permit database from CFEC, in addition to figures derived from this database showing new entrants by region. The included RMarkdown and two lookup tables are
used to generate these figures.","sociocultural economic commercial fishing featured","Commercial Fisheries Entry Commision Public Permit Database from 1975-2016","State of Alaska's Salmon and People","Year  Year permit was issued Fishery  Code indicating the species, gear code, and area code of the fishery Name  Name of permit holder Residency  Residency of permit holder.
