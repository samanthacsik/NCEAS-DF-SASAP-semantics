### Overview

Semantic annotations can help to improve data discoverablity within the State of Alaska's Salmon and People (SASAP) [data portal](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/projects/SASAP/Data). A current need is to evaluate metadata across the SASAP's data archive for commonly used (and perhaps "semantically important") terms, which may provide useful for constructing a salmon-specific ontology.

This repository provides code for:

  * querying SASAP datapackage metadata (titles, keywords, abstracts, and entity- & attribute-level information)
  * text mining and data wrangling necessary for extracting commonly used terms across various metadata fields
  * visualizing term frequencies

### Getting Started
